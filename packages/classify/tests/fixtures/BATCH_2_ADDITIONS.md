# Batch 2: Additional Real Data Additions

## Summary

Added **4 more real indicators** from World Bank data to cover previously uncovered categories.

## New Indicators Added

### 1. Unemployment Rate (Numeric/Measurement - Percentage)

**Indicator**: SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS - Unemployment, total (% of total labor force)
- **Country**: South Africa (ZAF)
- **Data Points**: 2017-2024 (8 years)
- **Range**: 26.9% to 34.0%
- **Key Feature**: Demonstrates persistently high unemployment (>25%)
- **Classification**:
  - Category: numeric-measurement
  - Type: percentage
  - Temporal Aggregation: not-applicable
  - Heat Map: lower-is-positive

**Why This Matters**: 
- Shows structural economic challenges in emerging markets
- Percentage indicator without temporal aggregation
- Real-world example of consistently high unemployment

### 2. GDP Per Capita (Numeric/Measurement - Ratio)

**Indicator**: NY.GDP.PCAP.CD - GDP per capita (current US$)
- **Country**: Luxembourg (LUX)
- **Data Points**: 2015-2022 (8 years)
- **Range**: $105,462 to $133,590
- **Key Feature**: Highest GDP per capita globally
- **Classification**:
  - Category: numeric-measurement
  - Type: ratio
  - Temporal Aggregation: not-applicable
  - Heat Map: higher-is-positive
  - Is Monetary: true

**Why This Matters**:
- Ratio indicator (GDP/population)
- Monetary ratio with very high values
- Represents developed market outlier
- Shows economic prosperity measurement

### 3. Export Growth (Change/Movement - Rate)

**Indicator**: NE.EXP.GNFS.KD.ZG - Exports of goods and services (annual % growth)
- **Country**: Vietnam (VNM)
- **Data Points**: 2016-2023 (8 years)
- **Range**: -1.3% to 17.3%
- **Key Feature**: Can turn negative, shows trade volatility
- **Classification**:
  - Category: change-movement
  - Type: rate
  - Temporal Aggregation: period-rate
  - Heat Map: higher-is-positive

**Why This Matters**:
- Growth rate that can be negative
- Shows trade dynamics and external demand
- Vietnam as export-oriented economy
- Real volatility in trade patterns

### 4. Import Growth (Change/Movement - Rate)

**Indicator**: NE.IMP.GNFS.KD.ZG - Imports of goods and services (annual % growth)
- **Country**: Philippines (PHL)
- **Data Points**: 2016-2023 (8 years)
- **Range**: -16.1% to 17.4%
- **Key Feature**: Sharp COVID-19 impact (-16.1% in 2020)
- **Classification**:
  - Category: change-movement
  - Type: rate
  - Temporal Aggregation: period-rate
  - Heat Map: neutral

**Why This Matters**:
- Dramatic negative value during crisis
- Shows domestic demand dynamics
- Neutral heat map (imports not inherently good/bad)
- Real-world crisis impact example

## Geographic Expansion

### New Countries Added:
1. **South Africa (ZAF)** - Sub-Saharan Africa
2. **Luxembourg (LUX)** - Western Europe (developed)
3. **Vietnam (VNM)** - Southeast Asia
4. **Philippines (PHL)** - Southeast Asia

### Regional Balance:
- **Emerging Markets**: South Africa, Vietnam, Philippines
- **Developed Markets**: Luxembourg
- **Economic Profiles**: 
  - High unemployment (South Africa)
  - High income (Luxembourg)
  - Export-oriented (Vietnam)
  - Import-dependent (Philippines)

## Categories Now Covered

### Previously Uncovered, Now Added:
1. ✅ **Numeric/Measurement - Percentage**: Unemployment rate
2. ✅ **Numeric/Measurement - Ratio**: GDP per capita (monetary)
3. ✅ **Change/Movement - Rate**: Export/Import growth (with negatives)

### Still Using Synthetic Data:
- Composite/Derived (index, correlation, elasticity, multiplier)
- Qualitative (sentiment, allocation)
- Temporal (duration, probability, threshold)

## Data Characteristics

### Value Ranges:
- **Unemployment**: 26.9% - 34.0% (high, persistent)
- **GDP per capita**: $105k - $134k (very high)
- **Export growth**: -1.3% to 17.3% (volatile)
- **Import growth**: -16.1% to 17.4% (extreme volatility)

### Temporal Patterns:
- **Unemployment**: Gradual increase with fluctuations
- **GDP per capita**: Steady growth with 2020 dip
- **Export growth**: High volatility, recent slowdown
- **Import growth**: Extreme 2020 drop, strong recovery

### Edge Cases Captured:
1. **Negative growth rates**: Both exports and imports
2. **Crisis impact**: -16.1% import drop in 2020
3. **High absolute values**: >$100k GDP per capita
4. **Structural issues**: Persistent >30% unemployment

## Testing Value

These additions enhance test coverage by providing:

1. **Percentage vs Ratio distinction**: Both are numeric measurements but behave differently
2. **Monetary ratios**: GDP per capita combines monetary and ratio characteristics
3. **Symmetric growth rates**: Export/import growth as complementary indicators
4. **Crisis scenarios**: Real COVID-19 impact data
5. **Developed market data**: Luxembourg provides high-income country perspective
6. **Structural challenges**: South Africa unemployment shows persistent issues
