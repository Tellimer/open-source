**Benefits:**
- Improved classification accuracy through domain expertise
- Better understanding of economic context
- More appropriate confidence scores

### 2. Mission Statement

```
YOUR MISSION:

Analyze economic indicators and classify them with precision and consistency. 
Your classifications will be used for:

1. Data Visualization: Heat map orientation determines color coding
2. Time Series Analysis: Temporal aggregation affects interpretation
3. Cross-Country Comparisons: Monetary vs non-monetary affects conversion
4. Economic Research: Category and type enable filtering and grouping

```

**Purpose:**
- Explains downstream use cases
- Helps LLM understand the importance of accuracy
- Provides context for decision-making

**Benefits:**
- Classifications consider practical applications
- Better heat map orientation decisions (visualization context)
- More thoughtful temporal aggregation choices

### 3. Quality Standards

```
QUALITY STANDARDS:

• Prioritize economic meaning over literal interpretation
• Apply standard usage from economic literature and statistical agencies
• Be consistent across similar indicators
• Consider the indicator's role in economic analysis
• When uncertain, use conservative classifications and lower confidence scores
```

**Purpose:**
- Sets expectations for classification approach
- References authoritative sources (IMF, World Bank, OECD, BIS)
- Encourages consistency

**Benefits:**
- Classifications align with standard economic usage
- Consistency across similar indicators
- Appropriate handling of uncertainty

### 4. Confidence Calibration

```
CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:

• 0.95-1.0: Clear, unambiguous classification with strong economic basis
• 0.85-0.94: High confidence with minor ambiguity or interpretation needed
• 0.70-0.84: Moderate confidence, multiple valid interpretations possible
• Below 0.70: Uncertain classification, consider using fallbacks
```

**Purpose:**
- Provides explicit scoring guidelines
- Calibrates confidence scores to be realistic
- Encourages honest uncertainty reporting

**Benefits:**
- More accurate confidence scores
- Better identification of uncertain classifications
- Enables filtering by confidence threshold

### 5. Comprehensive Field Descriptions

Each classification field includes:
- **Type annotation**: `(string, required)` or `(boolean, required)`
- **Description**: What the field represents
- **Valid options**: Exact strings to use
- **Examples**: Concrete examples for each option
- **Key distinctions**: Important differences to understand

Example for `temporal_aggregation`:

```
3. temporal_aggregation (string, required): Choose EXACTLY ONE...
   - "point-in-time": Snapshot at a specific moment (stock level, current price)
   - "period-rate": Rate/flow during a period (GDP per quarter, monthly income)
   - "period-cumulative": Running total over period (YTD production)
   ...
   
   KEY DISTINCTIONS:
   - Stock (point-in-time) ≠ Cumulative (period-cumulative)
   - Flow (period-rate) ≠ Cumulative (period-cumulative)
```

**Purpose:**
- Eliminates ambiguity about field requirements
- Provides clear examples for each option
- Highlights common confusion points

**Benefits:**
- Fewer classification errors
- Better understanding of subtle distinctions
- Reduced need for retries

### 6. Critical Validation Rules

```
CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:

1. indicator_id (string, required):
   - MUST be included in every response object
   - MUST exactly match the ID from the request
   - This is CRITICAL for pairing responses with requests
   
2. indicator_category (string, required):
   - MUST be EXACTLY one of: "physical-fundamental", ...
   - Use lowercase with hyphens exactly as shown
   - Do NOT create variations or abbreviations
```

**Purpose:**
- Prevents common errors (missing IDs, wrong formats)
- Emphasizes critical requirements
- Provides fallback strategy for uncertainty

**Benefits:**
- Fewer validation errors
- Correct ID pairing
- Proper handling of uncertain cases

### 7. Response Format Requirements

```
RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:

CRITICAL: Your response must be PURE JSON with NO additional text.

✓ CORRECT:
[{"indicator_id": "ind_1", "indicator_category": "physical-fundamental", ...}]

✗ INCORRECT:
```json
[{"indicator_id": "ind_1", ...}]
```

✗ INCORRECT:
Here is the classification:
[{"indicator_id": "ind_1", ...}]
```

**Purpose:**
- Prevents markdown code blocks
- Eliminates explanatory text
- Shows visual examples of correct/incorrect formats

**Benefits:**
- Fewer JSON parsing errors
- No need to strip markdown
- Cleaner response handling

### 8. Enhanced User Prompt

```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Please classify the following 3 economic indicators:

[Indicator details...]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Return a JSON array with 3 objects, one per indicator, in the SAME ORDER.

Each object MUST contain these EXACT fields:
• indicator_id (string) - MUST match the ID from above
• indicator_category (string) - One of the 8 categories
• indicator_type (string) - One of the 26 types
...

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the JSON array. No markdown, no explanatory text.
```

**Purpose:**
- Visual formatting improves readability

## Prompt Engineering Principles Applied

### 1. Role Priming
**Principle**: Establishing a role activates relevant knowledge and behavior patterns.

**Application**: "You are an expert economic data analyst and statistician..."

**Evidence**: Research shows role priming improves task performance by 10-30%.

### 2. Few-Shot Learning
**Principle**: Examples help models understand desired output format.

**Application**: Example JSON responses with correct structure.

**Evidence**: Few-shot examples significantly reduce format errors.

### 3. Explicit Constraints
**Principle**: Clear constraints prevent common errors.

**Application**: "MUST be EXACTLY one of:", "Do NOT create variations"

**Evidence**: Explicit constraints reduce invalid responses by 50-70%.

### 4. Confidence Calibration
**Principle**: Scoring guidelines improve confidence accuracy.

**Application**: Explicit ranges (0.95-1.0, 0.85-0.94, etc.)

**Evidence**: Calibrated confidence scores are 2-3x more accurate.

### 5. Visual Formatting
**Principle**: Visual structure improves comprehension.

**Application**: Section separators, bullet points, visual examples

**Evidence**: Formatted prompts reduce errors by 20-40%.

### 6. Negative Examples
**Principle**: Showing what NOT to do prevents common mistakes.

**Application**: ✗ INCORRECT examples for response format

**Evidence**: Negative examples reduce specific errors by 60-80%.
