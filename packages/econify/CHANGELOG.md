## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2024-12-29 - Wages Normalization & Time Sampling Release

üéâ **Major Feature Release**: This release introduces comprehensive wages data
normalization and advanced time sampling capabilities, solving critical issues
with incomparable economic wage data.

### üöÄ Release Highlights

- **Wages Data Pipeline**: Complete solution for mixed wage data (different
  currencies, time periods, and units)
- **Time Sampling Engine**: Advanced upsampling/downsampling with multiple
  interpolation methods
- **Work Hours Accuracy**: Proper distinction between work hours and calendar
  hours for wage calculations
- **Automatic Detection**: Smart identification of wage indicators for
  specialized processing
- **Comparable Results**: Transform incomparable data ranges into meaningful
  comparisons

### üìä Impact

**Before**: Wage data with ranges like 4.1 to 5,582,097 (meaningless) **After**:
Comparable ranges like $1,427 - $15,931 USD/month (meaningful)

### Added

- **Wages Data Normalization Module** - Specialized handling for wages/salary
  data with mixed units and currencies
- **Advanced Time Sampling** - Comprehensive upsampling and downsampling
  capabilities for economic time series
- **Pipeline Integration** - Enhanced data processing pipeline with
  wage-specific detection and handling
- **Work Hours vs Calendar Hours** - Accurate distinction for hourly wage
  conversions
- **Mixed Frequency Processing** - Automatic detection and conversion of
  different time periods (hourly, weekly, monthly, yearly)

### Enhanced

- **Currency Conversion** - Improved handling of wage data with proper
  time-then-currency conversion order
- **Data Type Detection** - Automatic separation of currency-based wages from
  index/points values
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error reporting with detailed exclusion
  reasons
- **Metadata Preservation** - Enhanced tracking of normalization steps and
  conversion factors

### Fixed

- **Wage Value Ranges** - Resolved incomparable value ranges (e.g., 4.1 to
  5,582,097) by proper normalization
- **Time Period Conversions** - Fixed hourly wage calculations to use work hours
  (2080/year) instead of calendar hours
- **Mixed Unit Handling** - Proper processing of indicators with multiple unit
  types (currency vs index)

  - Time conversion comparisons (simple vs enhanced)
  - Upsampling and downsampling examples
  - Mixed wage frequency processing
  - Different sampling method demonstrations

#### üìö Documentation

### Enhanced

#### üîÑ Data Processing Pipeline

- **Wage Detection** - Automatic identification of wage-related indicators
- **Mixed Data Type Handling** - Proper separation and processing of currency vs
  index data
- **Conversion Order** - Correct time-then-currency conversion sequence
- **Metadata Tracking** - Detailed conversion information and exclusion reasons

#### üí± Currency and Time Conversions

- **Work Hours Calculation** - Hourly wages use 2080 work hours/year
  (173.33/month) instead of calendar hours
- **Time Scale Factors** - Accurate conversion factors for all time periods
- **FX Rate Integration** - Seamless currency conversion with existing FX
  infrastructure
- **Batch Processing** - Efficient handling of large datasets

### Fixed

#### üìä Data Quality Issues

- **Value Range Normalization** - Wages data now has meaningful comparable
  ranges
  - Before: 4.1 to 5,582,097 (meaningless)
  - After: $1,427 - $15,931 USD/month (comparable)

- **Unit Standardization** - All wage data converted to consistent units
  - Mixed units: CAD/Hour, AUD/Week, CNY/Year, points
  - Standardized: USD/month for all currency-based wages

- **Time Period Accuracy** - Proper handling of different wage reporting
