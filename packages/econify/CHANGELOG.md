# Changelog

All notable changes to the econify package will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-01-16

### Fixed

- **Time Conversion Warning System**: Added proper warning when time conversion
  is requested but no source time scale is available
- **AFG Data Issue**: Resolved cases where yearly data wasn't being converted to
  monthly due to missing time scale information
- **Silent Conversion Failures**: System now provides clear warnings instead of
  silently failing when time conversion cannot be performed

### Added

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Clear console warnings when time conversion is
  requested but impossible to perform
- **Better Test Coverage**: Added 2 new tests for time conversion warning
  scenarios
- **Improved Debugging**: Warning messages help identify data quality issues

### Technical Details

- Enhanced `normalizeValue()` function with warning system for missing time
  scale information
- Added test coverage for warning scenarios in `normalization_test.ts`
- **227 Total Tests**: All passing with enhanced coverage
- Maintained full backward compatibility

### Example Warning Output

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Time conversion to month requested but no source time scale found in unit "USD Million" or explicit fields. Value unchanged.
```

This fix addresses the review issue where AFG data showed
`periodicity_adjusted: true` but no actual conversion was applied.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-01-16

### Added

- **Explicit Metadata Fields Support**: Enhanced `ParsedData` and `BatchItem`
  interfaces to accept explicit `periodicity`, `scale`, and `currency_code`
  fields
- **Smart Metadata Resolution**: Prioritizes explicit fields over unit string
  parsing for higher accuracy
- **Automatic Case Normalization**: Converts database values ("Quarterly" ‚Üí
  "quarter", "Billions" ‚Üí "billions") to match expected types
- **Enhanced Processing Logic**: Updated `normalizeValue()` and
  `buildExplainMetadata()` to use explicit metadata when available
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added 5 new tests covering explicit metadata
  priority logic and fallback behavior
- **New Example**: Added `explicit_metadata_example.ts` demonstrating the new
  feature with real-world scenarios
- **Updated Documentation**: Enhanced README with explicit metadata fields
  section and updated all examples

### Changed

- **Improved Data Processing**: Uses explicit database fields first, falls back
  to unit string parsing only when needed
- **Better API Design**: Matches clean database schema separation instead of
  forcing concatenated unit strings
- **Updated Examples**: Enhanced `explain_metadata_example.ts` to show explicit
  metadata fields integration
- **Test Coverage**: Increased from 221 to 223 passing tests with comprehensive
  explicit metadata validation

### Technical Details

- Added `normalizeScale()` and `normalizeTimeScale()` helper functions for case
  normalization
- Enhanced `processItem()` function to extract and use explicit metadata
- Updated normalization and explain metadata generation to prioritize explicit
  fields
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing unit string parsing

### Benefits

- **Higher Accuracy**: Explicit fields are more reliable than string parsing
- **Better Performance**: Less string parsing overhead
- **Cleaner Consumer Code**: No need to concatenate metadata into unit strings
- **Future Proof**: Works with any database schema design

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-16 - Time Scaling Fix

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Time Scaling**: Fixed missing `toTimeScale` parameter in `processBatch` call
  for standard economic data processing
  - Quarterly data now properly converts to monthly when
    `targetTimeScale: "month"` is specified
  - Quarterly values are correctly divided by 3 to get monthly equivalents
  - Explain metadata now accurately shows `periodicity_adjusted: true` when time
    scaling is applied
  - Resolves issue where quarterly data wasn't being converted despite correct
    configuration

### üîß Technical Details

- Added `toTimeScale: config.targetTimeScale` to the `normalizeDataService`
  batch processing options
- Time scaling was already working for wages data but was missing for general
  economic indicators
- All existing tests continue to pass, including time resampling scenarios

### üìä Impact

Before this fix, data like:

```typescript
{ value: -482.58, unit: "XOF Billions Quarterly" }
```

Would not be converted to monthly despite `targetTimeScale: "month"`
configuration.

After this fix, the same data correctly converts to monthly values with proper
explain metadata showing the time adjustment.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-16 - Explain Metadata Feature Release

üéØ **Explain Metadata Feature Release**: This release adds comprehensive
normalization metadata to provide transparency into FX rates, magnitude scaling,
and time adjustments.

### üèÜ Release Highlights

- **Explain Metadata**: New optional `explain` field provides detailed
  normalization metadata
- **FX Transparency**: Shows actual exchange rates used, source (live/fallback),
  and provider
- **Magnitude Clarity**: Captures scale conversions with exact factors (e.g.,
  billions‚Üímillions = 1000x)
- **Time Adjustments**: Records periodicity changes and whether temporal scaling
  was applied
- **Unit Provenance**: Clear original and normalized unit strings for full
  transparency
- **Backward Compatible**: Explain metadata is optional (default: false) to
  avoid overhead

### ‚ú® Added

- **New Types**: `Explain` interface with fx, magnitude, periodicity, and units
  metadata
- **Pipeline Option**: `explain?: boolean` flag in `PipelineConfig` to enable
  metadata
- **FX Source Tracking**: Captures whether rates came from live sources or
  fallback data
- **Magnitude Factors**: Exact conversion factors for scale changes (e.g., 1000
  for billions‚Üímillions)
- **Time Scale Recording**: Original and target time periods with adjustment
  flags
- **Unit Strings**: Human-readable original and normalized unit descriptions
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 10 new tests covering all explain metadata scenarios

### üîß Enhanced

- **Batch Processing**: Updated to support explain metadata generation
- **Wages Service**: Enhanced to include explain metadata for wage normalization
- **Pipeline Workflow**: FX source information now tracked through entire
  pipeline
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when explain metadata cannot be
  generated

### üìä Technical Details

- **Zero Performance Impact**: Explain metadata only generated when explicitly
  requested
- **Memory Efficient**: Metadata objects only created when needed
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Test Coverage**: All 218 tests passing including new explain functionality

### üí° Usage Example

```typescript
const config: PipelineConfig = {
  targetCurrency: "USD",
  targetMagnitude: "millions",
  explain: true, // Enable explain metadata
};

const result = await pipeline.run(data);
console.log(result[0].explain?.fx?.rate); // Shows actual FX rate used
console.log(result[0].explain?.magnitude?.factor); // Shows scale conversion factor
```

  // Wages detection and processing happens automatically
});
```

### üîÑ Breaking Changes Summary

- **Removed**: `processWagesIndicator()`, `createWagesPipelineConfig()`,
  `IndicatorData`, `ProcessingResult`
