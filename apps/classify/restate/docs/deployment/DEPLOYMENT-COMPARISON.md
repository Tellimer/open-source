## 🎯 Use Case Recommendations

### Development & Testing
**👉 Local Development**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
bun run dev:local
```

**Why:**
- Free
- Fast iteration
- Full debugging

---

### Small Production (< 10k indicators)
**👉 Railway**
```bash
# Deploy in 5 minutes
railway login
railway up
```

**Why:**
- Zero ops overhead
- High availability
- Automatic everything
- Worth the extra $2/month

---

### Medium Production (10k - 50k indicators)
**👉 Railway with Replicas**
```bash
# Scale to 5 replicas
# Railway Dashboard → classify-service → Replicas: 5
```

**Cost:** ~$150/month (infrastructure) + API costs

**Why:**
- Still easy to manage
- Good performance
- Reliable uptime
- Scales as needed

---

### Large Batch Processing (> 50k indicators)
**👉 AWS Spot with Pulumi**
```bash
cd infra
pulumi up
```

**Cost:** ~$111/month base + scales linearly

**Why:**
- 70% cost savings
- Handles massive scale
- Infrastructure as code
- AWS ecosystem benefits

## 🔄 Migration Paths

### Local → Railway (Easy)
```bash
# 1. Create Railway project
# 2. Deploy services (5 min)
# 3. Export database
pg_dump local_db | railway run psql $DATABASE_URL
```

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

### Local → AWS Spot (Medium)
```bash
# 1. Setup Pulumi
cd infra && pulumi up

# 2. Export database
pg_dump local_db > backup.sql
scp backup.sql ubuntu@$AWS_IP:~

# 3. Import on AWS
ssh ubuntu@$AWS_IP
docker exec -i timescaledb psql -U classify < backup.sql
```

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Railway → AWS Spot (Medium)
```bash
# 1. Deploy AWS infrastructure
cd infra && pulumi up

# 2. Backup Railway database
railway run pg_dump > railway-backup.sql

# 3. Restore on AWS
scp railway-backup.sql ubuntu@$AWS_IP:~
ssh ubuntu@$AWS_IP
docker exec -i timescaledb psql -U classify < railway-backup.sql
```

**Time:** 30 minutes

## 📈 Scaling Comparison

### Railway Scaling

**Vertical (Increase Resources):**
```
2GB RAM → 4GB → 8GB
2 vCPU → 4 vCPU → 8 vCPU
```

**Horizontal (Add Replicas):**
```
1 replica → 3 replicas → 10 replicas
Automatic load balancing
```

**Cost Impact:**
- Linear scaling
- $20/replica/month

---

### AWS Spot Scaling

**Vertical (Bigger Instance):**
```bash
pulumi config set instanceType m5.4xlarge
pulumi up
```

**Horizontal (Spot Fleet):**
```typescript
spotFleet: {
  targetCapacity: 10,
  diversified: true
}
```

**Cost Impact:**
- Non-linear (economies of scale)
- 70% cheaper than Railway at scale
