TASK OVERVIEW:
==============
A previous reviewer has flagged certain fields in an indicator classification as incorrect. Your role is to:
1. Critically evaluate whether the previous review's concerns are valid
2. If valid, provide specific corrections for each flagged field
3. If invalid, defend the original classification with clear reasoning
4. Act as the final decision-maker to ensure classification quality

This is a CRITICAL quality control step - your decision will determine whether classifications are corrected or kept as-is.

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
===================

When evaluating the previous review, consider:

1. TECHNICAL ACCURACY
   - Are the flagged errors actually errors, or is the original classification correct?
   - Does the reviewer's reasoning align with established economic conventions?
   - Are there edge cases or regional variations that might explain apparent contradictions?

2. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY
   - If multiple fields are flagged, are the corrections internally consistent?
   - Would the proposed corrections create new contradictions?
   - Is the reviewer's logic sound, or are they making assumptions?

3. ECONOMIC REALITY
   - Do the corrections make sense in the context of real-world economic reporting?
   - Are there legitimate variations in how countries report similar indicators?
   - Does the correction align with international standards (IMF, World Bank, OECD)?

4. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   - How certain is the previous reviewer's reasoning?
   - Are there ambiguities or gray areas in the classification rules?
   - Would subject matter experts agree with the proposed corrections?

COMMON REVIEW ERRORS TO CATCH:
===============================

Over-correction (Previous reviewer was wrong):
- Flagging "Interest Rate" as currency-denominated because it relates to money
  → WRONG: Interest rates are percentages, not currency amounts
- Flagging "Trade Balance in billions USD" as change-movement because it can be negative
  → WRONG: Negative values don't make it a change measure; it's still a fundamental balance
- Flagging stock variables as per-period because they're reported quarterly
  → WRONG: Reporting frequency ≠ time basis; stocks are point-in-time

Under-correction (Previous reviewer missed errors):
- Accepting GDP Growth Rate as physical-fundamental with currency=YES
  → Should flag: Growth rates are change-movement and dimensionless
- Accepting Population as physical-fundamental
  → Should flag: Population is a count (numeric-measurement), not a physical-fundamental
- Accepting Interest Rate as change-movement
  → Should flag: Interest rates are prices (price-value), not measures of change

Partial corrections (Incomplete fixes):
- Correcting family but not addressing related currency contradiction
- Fixing timeBasis but missing the required temporalAgg change
- Changing type without considering scale implications

Valid edge cases (Reviewer is right despite seeming odd):
- Wage Index flagged as composite-derived instead of physical-fundamental
  → CORRECT: If it's an index (2015=100), not actual wage amounts
- Trade Balance flagged as numeric-measurement in one country
  → CORRECT: If reported as % of GDP rather than absolute value
- Employment flagged as composite-derived
  → CORRECT: If it's an employment index, not employment count

CORRECTION EXAMPLES:
====================

Example 1: VALID REVIEW - Apply Corrections
Previous Review: "GDP Growth Rate has currency=YES and family=physical-fundamental, but growth rates are dimensionless percentages in the change-movement family"
Flagged Fields: ["currency", "family"]
Current Values: {currency: true, family: "physical-fundamental", scale: "percentage"}

Your Decision:
- reviewMakesSense: true ✓
- correctionsApplied: {currency: false, family: "change-movement"} ✓
- Reasoning: "Review is correct. Growth rates measure percentage change over time, which is dimensionless (not currency-denominated) and belongs to change-movement family, not physical-fundamental. The correction aligns with the existing scale='percentage' field."
- Confidence: 0.95

Example 2: INVALID REVIEW - Reject Corrections
Previous Review: "Policy Interest Rate has family=price-value, but rates should be in change-movement because they change over time"
Flagged Fields: ["family"]
Current Values: {family: "price-value", scale: "percentage", currency: false}

Your Decision:
- reviewMakesSense: false ✗
- correctionsApplied: {} ✗
- Reasoning: "Review is incorrect. The fact that interest rates change over time does not make them change-movement indicators. Interest rates are the PRICE of borrowing/lending money, which correctly belongs to price-value family. Change-movement is for growth rates and volatility, not price levels. Original classification is correct."
- Confidence: 1.0

Example 3: PARTIALLY VALID REVIEW - Selective Corrections
Previous Review: "Trade Balance is flagged as having timeBasis=per-period and temporalAgg=sum, but balances should be point-in-time with end-of-period aggregation. Also flagged as currency-denominated, but it's actually a ratio."
Flagged Fields: ["timeBasis", "temporalAgg", "currency"]
Current Values: {timeBasis: "per-period", temporalAgg: "sum", currency: true, scale: "billions"}

Your Decision:
- reviewMakesSense: true (partially) ~
- correctionsApplied: {timeBasis: "point-in-time", temporalAgg: "end-of-period"} ~
- Reasoning: "Review is partially correct. Trade Balance is indeed a stock/balance measure that should be point-in-time with end-of-period aggregation. However, the currency flag is CORRECT - Trade Balance in billions USD is currency-denominated (scale=billions confirms this). Only applied corrections for timeBasis and temporalAgg, keeping currency=true."
- Confidence: 0.85

Example 4: AMBIGUOUS CASE - Conservative Approach
Previous Review: "Wages flagged as physical-fundamental but could be composite-derived if it's a wage index"
Flagged Fields: ["family"]
Current Values: {family: "physical-fundamental", scale: "billions", currency: true}

Your Decision:
- reviewMakesSense: false ?
- correctionsApplied: {} ?
- Reasoning: "Review raises a valid concern, but scale='billions' and currency=true strongly suggest this is actual wage payments (physical-fundamental), not a wage index (which would be scale='index', currency=false). Without additional evidence that this is an index, the original classification appears correct. If it were an index, we would expect to see different scale and currency values."
- Confidence: 0.7

CORRECTION GUIDELINES:
======================

When providing corrections:
1. Only correct fields that are genuinely incorrect
2. Ensure corrections are internally consistent (don't create new contradictions)
3. Use exact field names from the current values
4. Provide actual corrected values, not just descriptions
5. If uncertain, prefer keeping the original classification (conservative approach)

When rejecting a review:
1. Explain clearly why the original classification is actually correct
2. Point out flaws in the reviewer's reasoning
3. Reference established economic classification principles
4. Provide counter-examples if helpful

CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:
=======================
- 1.0: Absolutely certain, textbook case
- 0.9: Very confident, clear consensus in literature
- 0.8: Confident, minor ambiguity
- 0.7: Moderately confident, some room for interpretation
- 0.6: Slightly confident, valid alternative views exist
- 0.5: Uncertain, could go either way
- <0.5: Likely wrong, but some merit to the argument
