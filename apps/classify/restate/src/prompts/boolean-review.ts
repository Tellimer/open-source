TASK OVERVIEW:
==============
Review the classification of an economic indicator across six critical dimensions and determine if the classification is internally consistent and economically sound. Your review should catch logical contradictions, methodological errors, and common classification mistakes.

REVIEW DIMENSIONS:
==================

1. TIME BASIS - How the indicator relates to time:
   - per-period: Flows measured over a time period (GDP, Exports, Government Spending)
   - point-in-time: Stocks measured at a specific moment (Reserves, Debt Outstanding, Population)
   - per-capita: Normalized by population (GDP per capita, Income per capita)
   - average: Average over a period (Average wage, Average price)
   - cumulative: Running total or year-to-date (YTD Exports, Cumulative Deficit)

2. SCALE - Units of measurement:
   - millions, billions, trillions: Large currency amounts
   - percentage: 0-100 range (Unemployment Rate, GDP Growth Rate)
   - percentage-points: Changes in percentages (Interest rate increased by 0.5 percentage points)
   - ratio: Proportions (Debt-to-GDP ratio as 0.85)
   - index: Rebased to 100 (CPI 2015=100)
   - units: Raw counts (Population, Number of firms)
   - basis-points: 1/100 of a percentage point (yield spread of 50 bps)
   - decimal: Small values (correlation coefficients, multipliers)

3. CURRENCY - Whether measured in monetary units:
   - YES: Expressed in currency (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
   - NO: Dimensionless, counts, percentages, indices

4. FAMILY - High-level economic category:
   - physical-fundamental: Real economic quantities (GDP, Trade, Production, Debt)
   - numeric-measurement: Counts, percentages, ratios (Unemployment Rate, Population)
   - price-value: Prices, yields, interest rates (Policy Rate, Stock Price, Exchange Rate)
   - change-movement: Growth rates, changes (GDP Growth, Inflation Rate)
   - composite-derived: Indices, scores, correlations (Consumer Confidence, Stock Index)
   - temporal: Durations, probabilities, thresholds
   - qualitative: Sentiment, allocations, classifications

5. TYPE - Specific economic indicator type:
   - Examples: Balance of Payments, Government Finance, Monetary, Prices, Production, Trade, Labor Market, National Accounts, Financial Markets, External Debt, Banking, Corporate, Commodities, Real Estate, Demographics, Social Indicators

6. TEMPORAL AGGREGATION - How data is combined across time:
   - average: Mean over period (Average monthly temperature)
   - sum: Total over period (Total quarterly GDP)
   - end-of-period: Value at period end (End-of-year reserves)
   - flow: Continuous flow during period (Monthly exports)
   - stock: Balance at a point in time (Outstanding debt)

COMMON ERROR PATTERNS TO CATCH:
================================

Currency-Family Contradictions:
- If Currency=YES but Family=numeric-measurement → INCORRECT (ratios aren't currency-denominated)
- If Currency=YES but Family=change-movement → INCORRECT (growth rates aren't currency-denominated)
- If Currency=YES, Family must be physical-fundamental OR price-value

Time Basis-Scale Contradictions:
- If TimeBasis=per-period but Type=Balance/Stock → INCORRECT (stocks are point-in-time)
- If TimeBasis=point-in-time but Type=Flow → INCORRECT (flows occur over periods)
- If TimeBasis=cumulative but TemporalAgg=average → INCORRECT (cumulative implies sum)

Family-Type Mismatches:
- Interest Rate in change-movement → INCORRECT (should be price-value)
- Growth Rate in price-value → INCORRECT (should be change-movement)
- Population in physical-fundamental → INCORRECT (should be numeric-measurement)
- Trade Balance in numeric-measurement → INCORRECT (should be physical-fundamental)

Scale-Family Inconsistencies:
- Family=price-value but Scale=billions → Usually INCORRECT (prices are typically small values or percentages)
- Family=numeric-measurement but Scale=millions → Check if it's a count (OK) or ratio (INCORRECT)
- Family=change-movement but Scale=billions → INCORRECT (growth rates are percentages/decimals)

Temporal Aggregation Errors:
- Stock indicator with TemporalAgg=sum → INCORRECT (stocks don't sum)
- Flow indicator with TemporalAgg=end-of-period → Usually INCORRECT
- Point-in-time with TemporalAgg=average → INCORRECT (single point has no average)

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT CLASSIFICATIONS:
====================================

Example 1: GDP
- TimeBasis: per-period ✓ (economic activity over a quarter/year)
- Scale: billions ✓ (large currency amount)
- Currency: YES ✓ (measured in USD/local currency)
- Family: physical-fundamental ✓ (real economic output in monetary terms)
- Type: National Accounts ✓
- TemporalAgg: sum ✓ (quarterly/annual total)
- Assessment: All fields consistent and correct

Example 2: Unemployment Rate
- TimeBasis: average ✓ (average over the survey period)
- Scale: percentage ✓ (0-100 range)
- Currency: NO ✓ (dimensionless ratio)
- Family: numeric-measurement ✓ (ratio of unemployed to labor force)
- Type: Labor Market ✓
- TemporalAgg: average ✓ (average rate during period)
- Assessment: All fields consistent and correct

Example 3: Policy Interest Rate
- TimeBasis: point-in-time ✓ (rate in effect at a moment)
- Scale: percentage ✓ (typically 0-20%)
- Currency: NO ✓ (percentage, not currency)
- Family: price-value ✓ (price of borrowing)
- Type: Monetary ✓
- TemporalAgg: end-of-period ✓ (rate at period end)
- Assessment: All fields consistent and correct

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT CLASSIFICATIONS:
=======================================

Example 4: GDP Growth Rate (INCORRECT)
- TimeBasis: per-period ❌ (should be point-in-time or average for the growth measurement)
- Scale: percentage ✓
- Currency: YES ❌ (growth rate is dimensionless percentage, not currency)
- Family: physical-fundamental ❌ (should be change-movement)
- Type: National Accounts ✓
- TemporalAgg: sum ❌ (should be average or change)
- Incorrect fields: ["timeBasis", "currency", "family", "temporalAgg"]
- Reasoning: Growth rates measure change (change-movement family), are dimensionless percentages (not currency), and show average change (not sum)

Example 5: Foreign Reserves (INCORRECT)
- TimeBasis: per-period ❌ (should be point-in-time for stock)
- Scale: billions ✓
- Currency: YES ✓
- Family: physical-fundamental ✓
- Type: Balance of Payments ✓
- TemporalAgg: sum ❌ (should be end-of-period or stock)
- Incorrect fields: ["timeBasis", "temporalAgg"]
- Reasoning: Reserves are a stock (balance at a point in time), not a flow over a period

Example 6: Consumer Confidence Index (INCORRECT)
- TimeBasis: average ✓
- Scale: index ✓
- Currency: NO ✓
- Family: numeric-measurement ❌ (should be composite-derived)
- Type: Social Indicators ✓
- TemporalAgg: average ✓
- Incorrect fields: ["family"]
- Reasoning: Confidence indices are composite measures derived from surveys, not simple numeric measurements

REVIEW PROCESS:
===============
1. Check each field individually for economic validity
2. Cross-check fields for logical consistency (currency-family, timebasis-temporalagg, scale-family)
3. Identify ALL incorrect fields - don't stop at the first error
4. Provide clear reasoning referencing specific contradictions
5. Assign confidence based on certainty of your assessment

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
==================
- 1.0: Absolutely certain, clear-cut case
- 0.8-0.9: Very confident, strong evidence
- 0.6-0.7: Moderately confident, minor ambiguity
- 0.4-0.5: Uncertain, conflicting indicators
- <0.4: Very uncertain, need more information

OUTPUT FORMAT:
==============
Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema:
{
  "isCorrect": boolean,
  "incorrectFields": string[],  // Array of field names that are incorrect (e.g., ["family", "type", "currency"])
  "reasoning": "Clear explanation of why the classification is correct or which specific fields are wrong and why",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Be thorough and rigorous in your review. Your assessment will be used to improve classification accuracy.`;
