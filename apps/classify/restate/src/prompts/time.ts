CLASSIFICATION TASK:
====================
You must classify this indicator on two dimensions:

1. REPORTING FREQUENCY: How often is this indicator reported/published?
2. TIME BASIS: How do the values accumulate or represent time?

REPORTING FREQUENCY OPTIONS:
=============================

1. **daily**: Indicator is reported every day
   - Keywords: "daily", "per day", "d", "1d"
   - Examples: Daily stock prices, daily exchange rates, daily commodity prices
   - Typical for: Financial markets, high-frequency economic data

2. **weekly**: Indicator is reported every week
   - Keywords: "weekly", "per week", "w", "1w"
   - Examples: Weekly unemployment claims, weekly retail sales
   - Typical for: Labor market indicators, short-term economic activity

3. **monthly**: Indicator is reported every month
   - Keywords: "monthly", "per month", "m", "1m", "mom"
   - Examples: CPI, unemployment rate, industrial production, retail sales
   - Typical for: Most economic indicators, government statistics
   - NOTE: This is the MOST COMMON frequency for economic indicators

4. **quarterly**: Indicator is reported every quarter (3 months)
   - Keywords: "quarterly", "per quarter", "q", "1q", "qoq", "Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"
   - Examples: GDP, corporate earnings, balance of payments
   - Typical for: National accounts, comprehensive economic measures

5. **annual**: Indicator is reported once per year
   - Keywords: "annual", "yearly", "per year", "y", "1y", "yoy", "per annum"
   - Examples: Annual GDP, yearly population, annual government budgets
   - Typical for: Census data, long-term structural indicators

6. **point-in-time**: Indicator is a snapshot with no regular reporting schedule
   - Use when: No clear frequency pattern, irregular updates, static reference data
   - Examples: One-time surveys, reference exchange rates, structural parameters
   - NOTE: Use this as a last resort when no frequency pattern is evident

TIME BASIS OPTIONS:
===================

1. **per-period**: Value represents a rate, flow, or amount DURING the period
   - Characteristics:
     * Measures activity/change within a time period
     * Values are specific to that period
     * Summing periods gives cumulative total
   - Keywords: "per month", "per year", "during", "in", "rate"
   - Examples:
     * Monthly inflation rate (2.5% in January)
     * Quarterly GDP growth (3.2% in Q1)
     * Annual exports ($500B in 2023)
     * Interest rate (5% per annum)
   - Common for: Rates, flows, changes, growth rates, most economic indicators

2. **point-in-time**: Value represents a snapshot or stock AT a specific moment
   - Characteristics:
     * Measures level/stock at a point in time
     * Value is valid for that instant only
     * Not summed across periods
   - Keywords: "at", "as of", "end of", "stock", "balance", "level"
   - Examples:
     * Population on January 1st (330M people)
     * Foreign reserves at year-end ($450B)
     * Unemployment rate at month-end (4.2%)
     * Stock price at close ($150.50)
   - Common for: Levels, stocks, balances, rates measured at specific times

3. **cumulative**: Value represents a running total from start of period
   - Characteristics:
     * Accumulates from period start (often year-to-date)
     * Each value includes all previous values
     * Resets at period boundaries (e.g., each January 1st)
   - Keywords: "YTD", "year-to-date", "cumulative", "running total", "accumulated"
   - Examples:
     * YTD government spending (accumulates monthly, resets yearly)
     * Cumulative rainfall (accumulates daily, resets yearly)
   - Common for: Year-to-date financial data, cumulative totals
   - RARE: Most indicators are per-period or point-in-time

CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY:
============================

Step 1: IDENTIFY REPORTING FREQUENCY
-------------------------------------
Follow this priority order:

A. Check UNITS field first:
   - Look for explicit time references: "per day", "per month", "quarterly", "annual"
   - Look for frequency indicators: "monthly", "M", "Q", "Y"
   - Time references in units are HIGHLY RELIABLE

B. Check PERIODICITY field second:
   - Standard values: "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", "Quarterly", "Annual"
   - This field is USUALLY the most reliable source

C. Use TIME SERIES ANALYSIS third:
   - Data point frequency can confirm or override metadata
   - Trust time series if it conflicts with periodicity (data is ground truth)

D. Default for economic indicators:
   - If unclear, most economic indicators are MONTHLY
   - Government statistics default to monthly reporting

Step 2: DETERMINE TIME BASIS
-----------------------------
Analyze the indicator's nature:

A. Rate/Flow indicators → per-period
   - Growth rates, changes, rates of change
   - Flows: exports, imports, production, consumption
   - Keywords: "rate", "growth", "change", "per"

B. Stock/Level indicators → point-in-time
   - Balances, reserves, population, assets
   - Unemployment rate (% at point in time)
   - Keywords: "balance", "stock", "level", "at", "as of"

C. Cumulative indicators → cumulative
   - Year-to-date values, running totals
   - Keywords: "YTD", "cumulative", "running total"
   - RARE: Only use when explicitly stated

Step 3: VALIDATE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------
Ensure your classification makes sense:
- Daily point-in-time: Stock prices, exchange rates ✓
- Monthly per-period: Inflation rate, production volume ✓
- Quarterly per-period: GDP growth ✓
- Annual point-in-time: Year-end population ✓

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
===================
- 1.0: Explicit time reference in units or periodicity, unambiguous
- 0.8-0.9: Strong indicators from metadata
- 0.6-0.7: Inferred from name or partial metadata
- 0.4-0.5: Weak signals, educated guess
- 0.2-0.3: Very uncertain, default assumptions

COMMON PATTERNS & EDGE CASES:
==============================

Pattern 1: "Index" indicators
- Usually point-in-time (snapshot of index level)
- Example: Consumer Price Index (CPI) → monthly, point-in-time

Pattern 2: Growth rates
- Always per-period (growth DURING the period)
- Example: "GDP Growth Rate" → quarterly, per-period

Pattern 3: Balances
- Always point-in-time (balance AT a moment)
- Example: "Trade Balance" → monthly, point-in-time

Pattern 4: "Per capita" indicators
- Usually per-period if measuring flows
- Example: "GDP Per Capita" → annual, per-period

Pattern 5: Prices
- Usually point-in-time (price AT observation time)
- Example: "Oil Price" → daily, point-in-time
